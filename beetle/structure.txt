how to make a func to put AT commands.
start is +++ 
Serial.print("+"); that is repeat many times.
Other AT commands is like that Serial.println("AT+RSSI=?");

return is void but real return variable is global v.
parameter is a command line

void putATcom(char* a)
{
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
    
    // put AT commands.
    if a = +++ {
        Serial.print("+");
        ...
        ...
    }

    else {
        Serial.println(a);
    }

    // get the answer
    while (Serial.available() > 0){
        if ( (chr = Serial.read() != '\n') ) ;
        buffer[i++] = chr;
    }
    buffer[i] = '\n';
   
    // save buffer to ret
    for ( j = 0; j <= i; j++ ){
        ret[j] = buffer[j];
    }
}
